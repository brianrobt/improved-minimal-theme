# iMproved - An improved minimal theme

This is a fork of the [i Minimal](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/i-theme)
theme by [@ctrlplusb](https://github.com/ctrlplusb).  I forked this and
uploaded a new theme because I liked the theme a lot, but thought some
items were not displaying correctly.  Please open an issue if there was
something that I missed or you have a suggestion!  I check GitHub on a
daily basis.

This theme works very well with the
[NightSwitch](https://github.com/gharveymn/nightswitch) plugin.

I recommend to use a font that supports "cursive italics".  The one I
use is [Cartograph CF](https://connary.com/cartograph.html).  It is a
paid font, but you can download it for free from sites like
bestfonts.pro.  For example, [Ellograph
CF](https://en.bestfonts.pro/font/ellograph-cf) is another font from the
creator of Cartograph CF and is available on bestfonts.pro.  If you
decide to download it for free, but end up liking it, then I recommend
you buy the official version.  $40 isn't cheap for a font, but please
show support by buying from the creator if you end up liking and using the font.

## Fixes

- Background and foreground no longer the same for focused elements,
  such as inline suggestions and in the Command Palette.

## There is no iMproved Solarised

I got rid of the *i Solarised* since I had made no changes to it and
don't plan to use it.  If you want it, create and issue and I can add it
back in.  Or, even better, suggest which changes you would like to see
in an *iMproved Solarised* theme.
